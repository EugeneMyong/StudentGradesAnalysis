# StudentGradesAnalysis

A project that analyzes whether personal/mental health factors such as family relationships or academic factors such as study time has more of an impact on students grades. We also quantified how the grades were affected by different factors, as well as how the factors influenced each other and how the grades changed over time when different factors were analyzed.

This project was done collaboratively in a group of five people for the Data Science in Practice class at UCSD. To respect team member's privacy, their names were changed to Anonymous.
